NEWS
====

**2018 July 9**

Hi everyone! We wanted to let you know why we haven't pushed changes into this repo for a while: we're working on roboschool2, a
new codebase with different priorities, which we hope will further accelerate robotics research. We continue to recommend the
use of roboschool1 Hopper, Ant, Humanoid and Flagrun for evaluation and testing of algorithms. If you have fixes to make
installation easier we'll be happy to merge it. We'll have more to share about roboschool2 in a while.


**2017 July 17, Version 1.1**

* All envs version bumped to â€œ-v1", due to stronger stuck joint punishment, that improves odds of getting a good policy.
* Flagrun-v1 is much more likely to develop a symmetric gait,
* FlagrunHarder-v1 has new "repeat-underlearned" learning schedule, that allows it to be trained to stand up, walk and turn without falling. 
* Atlas robot model, modified (empty links removed, overly powerful feet weakaned).
* All -v1 envs are shipped with better zoo policies, compared to May versions.
* Keyboard-controlled humanoid included.


Roboschool
==========

Release blog post is here:

https://blog.openai.com/roboschool/


Roboschool is a long-term project to create simulations useful for research. The roadmap is as follows:

1. Replicate Gym MuJoCo environments.
2. Take a step away from trajectory-centric fragile MuJoCo tasks.
3. Explore multiplayer games.
4. Create tasks with camera RGB image and joints in a tuple.
5. Teach robots to follow commands, including verbal commands.

Environments List
=================

The list of Roboschool environments is as follows:

- RoboschoolInvertedPendulum-v0
- RoboschoolInvertedPendulumSwingup-v0
- RoboschoolInvertedDoublePendulum-v0
- RoboschoolReacher-v0
- RoboschoolHopper-v0
- RoboschoolWalker2d-v0
- RoboschoolHalfCheetah-v0
- RoboschoolAnt-v0
- RoboschoolHumanoid-v0
- RoboschoolHumanoidFlagrun-v0
- RoboschoolHumanoidFlagrunHarder-v0
- RoboschoolPong-v0

To obtain this list: `import roboschool, gym; print("\n".join(['- ' + spec.id for spec in gym.envs.registry.all() if spec.id.startswith('Roboschool')]))`.



Installation
============

First, define a `ROBOSCHOOL_PATH` variable in the current shell. It will be used in this README but not anywhere in the Roboschool code.

```bash
ROBOSCHOOL_PATH=/path/to/roboschool
```

If you have both Python2 and Python3 on your system, use `python3` and `pip3` commands.

The dependencies are gym, Qt5, assimp, tinyxml, and bullet (from a branch). For the non-bullet deps, there are several options, depending on what platform and package manager you are using.

- Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    apt install cmake ffmpeg pkg-config qtbase5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libassimp-dev libpython3.5-dev libboost-python-dev libtinyxml-dev
    ```

    Users report in issue #15 that `sudo pip3 install pyopengl` can make OpenGL errors go away, because it arranges OpenGL libraries in
    an Ubuntu system in the right way.



- Linuxbrew

    ```bash
    brew install boost-python --without-python --with-python3 --build-from-source
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/user/.linuxbrew/include:/home/user/.linuxbrew/include/python3.6m
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/user/.linuxbrew/include:/home/user/.linuxbrew/include/python3.6m
    export LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/.linuxbrew/lib
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/.linuxbrew/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
    ```

    (still use Qt from Ubuntu, because it's known to work)

- Mac, homebrew python:

    ```bash
    # Will not work on Mavericks: unsupported by homebrew, some libraries won't compile, upgrade first
    brew install python3
    brew install cmake tinyxml assimp ffmpeg qt
    brew reinstall boost-python --without-python --with-python3 --build-from-source
    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin:$PATH
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/lib/pkgconfig
    ```

- Mac, Anaconda with Python 3

    ```bash
    brew install cmake tinyxml assimp ffmpeg
    brew reinstall boost-python --without-python --with-python3 --build-from-source
    conda install qt
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(dirname $(dirname $(which python)))/lib/pkgconfig
    ```


Compile and install bullet as follows. Note that `make install` will merely copy files into the roboschool directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/olegklimov/bullet3 -b roboschool_self_collision
mkdir bullet3/build
cd    bullet3/build
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DUSE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$ROBOSCHOOL_PATH/roboschool/cpp-household/bullet_local_install -DBUILD_CPU_DEMOS=OFF -DBUILD_BULLET2_DEMOS=OFF -DBUILD_EXTRAS=OFF  -DBUILD_UNIT_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_CLSOCKET=OFF -DBUILD_ENET=OFF -DBUILD_OPENGL3_DEMOS=OFF ..
make -j4
make install
cd ../..
```

Finally, install project itself:

```bash
pip3 install -e $ROBOSCHOOL_PATH
```

Now, check to see if it worked by running a pretrained agent from the agent zoo.


Agent Zoo
=========

We have provided a number of pre-trained agents in the `agent_zoo` directory.

To see a humanoid run towards a random varying target:

```bash
python $ROBOSCHOOL_PATH/agent_zoo/RoboschoolHumanoidFlagrun_v0_2017may.py
```

To see three agents in a race:

```bash
python $ROBOSCHOOL_PATH/agent_zoo/demo_race2.py
```
